<h1>About Me</h1>

<div id = "about">
<h3>
I'm a third-year student at the University of California, San Diego. I am currently studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction with a minor in Business. I'm interested in computers, design, and photography and strive to find new ways to expand my knowledge in these fields throughout my life, while still finding time for fun. A goal of mine at an early age was to learn various coding languages to create websites. Website structures and layouts have always intrigued me which has led to my pursuit in this profession. I am able to dive further into my passion by creating and deploying interfaces based on user goals and needs.</h3>
